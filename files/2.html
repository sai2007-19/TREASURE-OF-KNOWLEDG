    <br>
    <p class="box">Daripalli Ramaiah carries seeds in his pockets and travels indefinite distances to reach a spot of
        barren land so that he could plant the seeds and saplings he was carrying. He sold his three-acre plot of land
        to gather the necessary funds to purchase
        seeds and plant saplings. When someone gifted him Rs. 5,000 during his son’s marriage, he used that money also
        to this cause! He carries a scarf which says <span>“Vriksho Rakshati Rakshitaha”</span> whenever he sets out to
        plant saplings.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Anand Kumar hails from Patna where his father was a clerk. His humble beginnings got in the way of him going to
        attend Cambridge University which at the time had offered him a seat. His papers on the 'Number Theory' were
        published in international mathematical magazines. He would work on mathematics during the day and sell paapad
        in the evening. 15 years later, 27 of the 30 students he trained ended up clearing the IIT-JEE exam. Recently a
        move released called "SUPER 30" which is inspired by him.</p>

        Born in 1986 to an economically weak family, Shekar Naik suffered from blindness since birth. Without much
        privilege and support, Shekar Naik's keen interest in sports could never be fuelled as a kid. At the age of 12,
        he was selected in the state level tournament, which was when his cricketing talent was noticed for the first
        time. 17 years later, he would go on to captain Indian Blind Cricket Team. At a time when Bollywood is finally
        embracing real life heroes, we can expect a biopic on Shekar Naik one of these days.And he is the <span>"First
            blind cricketer to be awarded the Padma Shri"</span>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Born in 1865 and married off at the age of 9, Anandibai Joshi overcame repression and stigma at a time when
        women's education was deemed irrelevant by the patriarchal society. She not only fought for her dreams but also
        managed to train herself in western medicine, becoming the only female physician from South Asia at the time.
        With the help of a liberal husband, Anandibai opened the gates for Indian women who wanted to be more than just
        housewives.
